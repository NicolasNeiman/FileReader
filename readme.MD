# File Reader

A small Console App to play with some basic tools:
- Args passed to the main method of a Console App
- Basic System methods : `Directory.GetCurrentDirectory()`, `File.Exists(string path)` 
- Basic file manipulation : `File.OpenText(string path)` which outputs a `StreamReader` object on which we can apply the `ReadLine()` method  



To use it on windows : go to bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1 and execute FileReader.exe followed by the name of the file to display.
```
FileReader.exe testFile.txt
```
